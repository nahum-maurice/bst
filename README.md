# Binary Search Tree
This is an implementation of a binary search tree and some fancy actions of it in a browser.

## Description
  A binary search tree is a node-based binary tree. A data
  structure with the properties
  
* The left subtree of a node has only keys that are less than itself's keys.
* The right subtree of a node has only keys that are greater than itself's keys.
* The lest and right subtrees are also BST.
* Duplicated keys are not allowed.
 
 A node is actually a number that can be added with some meta information that indicate their relationship with other numbers in the tree.
